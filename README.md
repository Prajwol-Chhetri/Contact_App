# Contact_App

This App is built using tkinter module of python to get GUI in which users can enter the contact details they wish to store. The contacts that the user stores are recorded and stored in database using sqlite3 module. If the database is not created database.py file must be executed first to create a database to store user recorded contacts. User can view the contact or delete or edit certain contact.
